Shortest Job First (SJF) could result in starvation in the case where there are many short jobs
that are continually added, which will starve long jobs. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) could 
also result in starvation in same case where short processes are continually added and get to be completed
before a long process even has a chance to start. Priority scheduling algorithm may result in starvation
for processes that have a low priority because the higher priority processes may take an indefnite amount of 
time to complete, thus the low priority processes will have to wait indefinitely.
