A process is a program that is in execution while a thread is a path of execution that 
is contained within a process. Another difference would be that multiple threads in a 
process share the same address space but multiple process will not. If the task to be 
executed is large, such as opening a web browser, it would be preferable to use a process. 
If the task to be executed is small, such as handling a web page request, it would be 
preferable to use a thread.
