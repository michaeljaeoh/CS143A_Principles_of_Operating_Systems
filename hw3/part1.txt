Concurrency can be useful because it allows for the handling of events that 
are happening in parallel such as handling multiple web page requests at the 
same time. It can also be useful because it can allow for efficient use of
time during the execution of an application by allowing for different tasks
to be completed while waiting for the input/output operations to finish.
This ability to be able to switch back and forth between different tasks is
what makes it useful on a single-CPU machine because it allows to create the
illusion of programs running concurrently.
