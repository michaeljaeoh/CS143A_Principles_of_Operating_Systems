In order to read the file /foo/bar the file system(fs) must find the inode for bar. The fs will need to traverse the given
pathname to find this inode. For the first step, the fs will read the block from the disk with the inode number of the root directory.
Afterwards, the fs will locate the pointer that leads to the entry foo and identify it's inode number. The fs will 
then go to the block with the inode number associated with foo and locate the pointer to bar. Once located, the 
fs will read the inode number for bar into memory. The fs will then check the permissions on the file, specify the file as
being opened, and return the file to the user. In this process, there will be a total of 3 disk accesses.
