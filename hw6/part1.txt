The condition of "mutual exclusion" holds because a chopstick can only be held by one philosopher
at any point in time. The condidtion of "hold and wait" holds because the philosophers will hold onto
one chopstick and wait until another chopstick is available before they can begin eating. The condition
of "no preemption" holds because the philosophers are unable to speak to each other, meaning they cannot
tell another philosopher that they need a chopstick and could potentially be waiting for another chopstick
to become available indefinitely. The condition of a "circular wait" holds because there is a scenario
where each philosopher is holding the chopstick on their right and waiting on the philospher to their left to
put down their chopstick. Deadlocks could be avoided by eliminatin any of of the four conditions because these
four conditions are somewhat related to each other. If there is no "mutual exclusion", then a chopstick can be used
at the same time by more than one philosopher so there will be no need for "holding and waiting" and will also remove
the condition of "circular wait". If "preemption" is allowed, the philosophers would be able to speak to one another 
and ask for a chopstick from another philosopher instead of silently waiting forever.
